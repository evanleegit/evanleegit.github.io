        <p>
          I’m an undergraduate student interested in building thoughtful, reliable systems 
          at the intersection of design, data, and engineering. My background 
          in statistics, economics, and cognitive science shapes how I approach 
          problems analytically and pragmatically, with real-world constraints 
          in mind. tside of work, I spend a lot of time on my home server, data 
            experiments, and personal electronics projects.
